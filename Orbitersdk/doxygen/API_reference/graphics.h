  \page graphics Graphics Client Development

  This page contains information for developers of plug-in graphics clients
  for the non-graphics version of Orbiter (Orbiter_NG).

  Graphics clients are DLL modules which contain the implementation of a
  client class derived from oapi::GraphicsClient. They handle the device-
  specific aspects of rendering a 3-D window into the "orbiter world".
