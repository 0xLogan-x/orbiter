[x] DOC: Bring flight recorder documentation up to date.
--> Implemented 060406

[ ] BUG: planetary parameters: incorporate Chode's corrected data.

    standard orbiter (admin@sls.pl)

    in Atlantis bay. Don't allow to stow RMS when something is attached.

[ ] REQ: Support sun textures other than star.dds
    E.g. have Star1 = NGC7293 in psys config file, then use NGC7293.dds

[ ] BUG: Too rapid transition of night city light textures.

[ ] BUG: IMFD: (1) erratic behaviour of button labels in glass cockpit view.
    (2) crashes in external MFD windows.
    Requires cooperation from author to update to 2006 version.
    Possible solution to (1): IMFD should call the new MFD::InvalidateButtons
    method whenever the PG button is pressed.
    Possible solution to (2): IMFD should support more than 2 MFD slots, or
    at least trap situations where it is called from an external window.

[ ] BUG: calling order between opcOpenRenderViewport() and MFD constructors
    changes for a scenario restart.

[ ] REQ: a plugin callback function that is called after all cleanup for
    a terminating session has been executed.

    calculation.

    correctly updated when editing simulation time.

[ ] REQ: Allow vessel visual parameters to be controlled by config file tags.
